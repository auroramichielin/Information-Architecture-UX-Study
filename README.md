# Information Architecture & UX Design Case Study 🏗️

A strategic UX Research and Information Architecture project for a digital reading platform.

> **Note**: While this documentation is in English, the project assets (Miro boards and diagrams) are written in **Italian**.

## 📌 Project Overview
This study follows a user-centric design approach to solve navigation and organization challenges for readers. The goal was to build a logical ecosystem connecting different user types, from casual readers to independent authors.

## 🛠 Methodology & Tools
* **Tool**: Miro
* **Phase 1: UX Research**: Defined 4 User Personas (The Social Reader, The Organized Reader, The Discovery Seeker, The Connected Author).
* **Phase 2: Information Architecture**: Developed a comprehensive Sitemap and User Flow to optimize the navigation experience.
* **Phase 3: Wireframing**: Created low-fidelity structural layouts for the main application screens.
